Car Rental System - C++ Simulation
The Car Rental System is a (console) application developed in C++ that simulates a car rental platform. It provides a platform for car owners to offer their cars for rent, and renters to browse and book available cars. This project showcases the implementation of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts, design patterns, and code refactoring techniques to ensure a well-structured and maintainable codebase.

Features

User Roles: The system supports three main user roles - owners, renters, and the admin. Each user has a unique username and password for authentication.

Car Listing and Verification: Car owners can register their vehicles by providing detailed information such as make, model, year, rental rates, and availability. The admin verifies these cars and makes them available for renters. The admin also sets a commission rate for each car.

Booking Management: Renters can browse through the available cars and request bookings for their desired vehicles. Owners receive notifications when their cars are rented.

User Authentication: User authentication functionality ensures the security and privacy of user data. Users can create accounts, log in, and manage their profiles.

Notifications: Owners receive notifications when their cars are rented and when their cars are verified by the admin.

Available Car Listings: Renters can view all available cars and choose to rent the car that suits their preferences.

Admin Dashboard: The admin has access to a dashboard that displays all rental orders, users, cars, and other relevant information. This allows the admin to efficiently manage the system.
